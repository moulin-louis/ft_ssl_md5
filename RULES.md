- if no args after command:
    - use stdin -> (stdin) = hash
- -q cancel the -r
- if something after command:
    - try open it as a file -> MD5(file name) = hash
- if -s after command:
    - use the string after -s -> MD5(string) = hash
- -p trigger a stdin read:
    - read stdin -> (stdin content) = hash
- if no -p and something after command:
    - try open it as a file -> MD5(file name) = hash
- flag are applied before a -p or a file and reset after
- once we found a file, everything after is a file
- -r doesn't apply to -p
